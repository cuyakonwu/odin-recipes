    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Many cultures have put a spin on the empanada. This recipe descends from
    the Argentine way of making these little meat pies. The Argentine empanada
    is small, just two or three delicious bites. The technique to master in this
    recipe is holding the open empanada with one hand and using the other hand
    to crimp the outer edge and for a decorative braid. The less dexterous among
    us should use a fork for this.</p>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <h4><strong>For the Dough</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces lard or butter, plus more for brushing tops</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons fine sea salt</li>
            <li>750 grams all-purpose flour, about 6 cups, more as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h4<><strong>For the Filling</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound beef chuck, in ⅛-inch dice (or very coarsely ground)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Lard or olive oil, or a combination, for sautéing</li>
            <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
            <li>2 ounces diced chorizo</li>
            <li>½ pound potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, mashed to a paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped thyme</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped marjoram or 1 teaspoon oregano</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pimentón dulce or paprika</li>
            <li>Large pinch cayenne</li>
            <li>Beef or chicken broth, as necessary, or use water</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped scallions, white and green parts</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped pitted green olives</li>
            <li>2 hard-cooked eggs, sliced</li>
        </ul>

    <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Make the dough: Put 2 cups boiling water, 4 ounces lard and 1½
        teaspoons salt in large mixing bowl. Stir to melt lard and dissolve
        salt. Cool to room temperature.</p></li>
        <li><p>Gradually stir in flour with a wooden spoon until dough comes
        together. Knead for a minute or two on a floured board, until firm and
        smooth. Add more flour if sticky. Wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Make the filling: Season chopped beef generously with salt and
        pepper and set aside for 10 minutes. Melt 3 tablespoons lard in a wide
        heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and fry until nicely
        browned, stirring throughout to keep pieces separate, about 5 minutes.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Turn heat down to medium and add onion and chorizo. Keep turning
        mixture with a spatula, as if cooking hash, until onion is softened and
        browned, about 10 minutes. Add potatoes, garlic, thyme and marjoram and
        stir well to incorporate. (Add a little more fat to pan if mixture seems
        dry.) Season again with salt and pepper and let mixture fry for 2 more
        minutes. Stir in tomato paste, pimentón and cayenne, then a cup of broth
        or water. Turn heat to simmer, stirring well to incorporate any
        caramelized bits.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook for about 10 more minutes, until both meat and potatoes are
        tender and the sauce just coats them — juicy but not saucy is what you
        want. Taste and adjust seasoning for full flavor (intensity will
        diminish upon cooling). Stir in scallions and cool to room temperature,
        then cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</p></li>
        <li><p>Divide chilled dough into 1-ounce pieces and form into 2-inch
        diameter balls. Roll each piece into a 4½-inch circle. Lay circles on a
        baking sheet lightly dusted with flour.</p></li>
        <li><p>Moisten outer edge of each round with water. Put about 2
        tablespoons filling in the center of each round, adding a little chopped
        green olive and some hard-cooked egg to each. Wrap dough around filling
        to form empanada, pressing edges together. Fold edge back and finish by
        pinching little pleats or crimping with a fork.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat oven to 375 degrees. Place empanadas on parchment-lined or
        oiled baking sheet, about 1 inch apart. Brush tops lightly with lard or
        butter and bake on top shelf of oven until golden, 10 to 15 minutes.
        Serve warm.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong><em>TIP</em></strong></p>
    <p>Dough and filling may each be prepared a day or two in advance. The
    empanadas may be assembled several hours ahead of time and refrigerated,
    uncovered. Bring to room temperature before baking.</p>
